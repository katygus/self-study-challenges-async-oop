/**
 * CHALLENGE 1: Bird
 * You are working with National Geographic on a bird tracking application.
 * You are tasked with creating a function that returns objects representing
 * different birds. Each `Bird` object should contain the following properties,
 * which are initially set via arguments when the object is created:
 *
 * `species` (string representing the bird's species)
 * `color` (string representing the bird's color)
 * `locations` (array of locations where the bird has been found)
 *
 * The following methods must also be available to every instance of a Bird object
 * (but not stored on the individual objects themselves):
 * `getColor` (returns the color of the bird)
 * `setColor` (sets a new color for the bird)
 * `getLocations` (returns the locations where the bird was found)
 * `addLocation` (adds a new location to the locations array)
 *
 * The methods that take an argument must accept only one argument, and it must be a string.
